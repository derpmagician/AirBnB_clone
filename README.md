# AirBnB_clone - The Console

![airbnb_img](https://i.imgur.com/U8B8g4H.png)

The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

And the final data diagram looks like this:

# First step and GOAl of this repository: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building the first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

## What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Execution

The hbnb command interpreter should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C):

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```

All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: ``` $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash ```
